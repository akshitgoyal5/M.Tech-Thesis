\begin{observation}
\label{ob:frequency}
If two subgraphs have higher support values individually, it is very likely that the pair will also have a higher correlation.
\end{observation}

\begin{observation}
\label{ob:dfs}
For highly (e.g., top-$k$) correlated subgraphs mining, generally a breadth-first or a best-first exploration of the search space is more efficient
compared to a depth-first traversal of the search space.
\end{observation}

Setting $k$ to infinity would enable us to mine all pairs of correlated subgraph patterns. However, on the contrary, it is hard to control the value of {\sf Min-sup} to get the result of a particular $k$ of {\sf Top-$k$} correlated subgraphs. That is to say, the {\sf Min-Sup} problem can be transfered from {\sf Top-$k$} problem. As a result, we concentrate on {\sf Top-$k$} problem in the following sections.
