\begin{abstract}
Mining of correlated patterns, that represent an important class of
regularities, has become increasingly important in data management and
analytics. Surprisingly, the problem of correlated subgraphs mining from a
single, large graph has received little attention. We investigate a novel and
critical graph mining problem, called correlated subgraphs mining, which is
defined as a pair of subgraph patterns that frequently co-occur in proximity
within a single graph.

Correlated subgraphs are different from frequent subgraphs due to the
flexibility in which the constituent subgraph instances are connected, thus the
existing frequent subgraphs mining algorithms cannot be directly applied.
Furthermore, correlation computation between two subgraph patterns require
enumerating and finding distances between every pair of subgraph instances of
both these patterns --- which are both memory intensive and computationally
demanding. 

To this end, we design a novel, single-step, best-first exploration algorithm to
detect correlated subgraph patterns: To further improve the efficiency, we
develop a top-$k$ pruning strategy, while to reduce the memory footprints, we
develop a compressed data structure, called $\mathcal{R}$eplica that stores all
instances of a subgraph pattern. Our empirical results show that the proposed
algorithm not only finds interesting correlations, but also achieves good
performance for finding correlated subgraphs in large graphs.
